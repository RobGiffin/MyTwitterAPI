Two versions

A curl version which take a parameter and requires CURL to be available in PHP

And a second version non-curl (the default index.php) which doesn't take a parameter, but doesn't require CURL 

Example parameter below.

Twitter API
/index.php?account=nasa

CURL version uses TwitterAPIExchange.php file from the link below.  Thanks to the dev who created this as they made my life a lot easier
